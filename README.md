# Younger-Logics-Core
Younger - Logics - Core

Younger-Logics-Core is the core module of the Younger project, focusing on organizing and managing the logic of deep learning models. It builds high-level logical representations from structured information extracted from code, capturing modular components and functional hierarchies. Younger-Logics-Core enables the analysis of model construction logic and module dependencies, providing a foundation for semantic understanding and advanced optimizations.
